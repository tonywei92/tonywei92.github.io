            Hi there! I'm <span className="font-semibold">Tony Soekirman</span>{" "}
            but I usually go by <span className="font-semibold">Tony Song</span>{" "}
            professionaly, I'm a passionate full-stack developer with over a
            decade of experience in backend, frontend, and cloud technologies. I
            love building scalable applications and have a genuine interest in
            infrastructure and DevOps. Over the years, I've had the opportunity
            to work on a variety of projects across different industries, from
            e-commerce to SaaS products, where I've been able to develop my
            skills in PHP, Golang, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been fortunate to lead teams as a CTO at MetaPals, where I
            helped design a game engine solutions for chromium browsers. My
            enthusiasm for building goes beyond just codingâ€”I enjoy exploring
            new tools and frameworks, which has inspired me to create custom
            Laravel packages and delve into Kubernetes. Lately, I've been
            working on a Golang project to monitor CPU usage across multiple
            platforms, blending my interests in system-level programming and
            distributed architecture.

            My Current Focus

          <p>
            At the moment, I'm working on a personal blog and portfolio to share
            my projects, contributions to open-source, and some of my tech
            experiments. I'm also diving deeper into Kubernetes in combination
            with RHEL. It's been a challenging but rewarding learning
            experience. Also, I'm writing a detailed article on my experience in
            tech, I often prefer using a real-world case study to explain the
            technology so it's easier to understand.
