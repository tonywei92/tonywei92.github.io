              Hi there! I'm{" "}
              <span className="font-semibold">Tony Soekirman</span> but I
              usually go by <span className="font-semibold">Tony Song</span>{" "}
              professionaly, I'm a passionate full-stack developer with over a
              decade of experience in backend, frontend, and cloud technologies.
              I love building scalable applications and have a genuine interest
              in infrastructure and DevOps. Over the years, I've had the
              opportunity to work on a variety of projects across different
              industries, from e-commerce to SaaS products, where I've been able
              to develop my skills in PHP, Golang, JavaScript/TypeScript, and
              Python.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've been fortunate to lead teams as a CTO at MetaPals, where I
              helped design a game engine solutions for chromium browsers. My
              enthusiasm for building goes beyond just codingâ€”I enjoy exploring
              new tools and frameworks, which has inspired me to create custom
              Laravel packages and delve into Kubernetes. Lately, I've been
              working on a Golang project to monitor CPU usage across multiple
              platforms, blending my interests in system-level programming and
              distributed architecture.

              <p>
                At the moment, I'm working on a personal blog and portfolio to
                share my projects, contributions to open-source, and some of my
                tech experiments. I'm also diving deeper into Kubernetes in
                combination with RHEL. It's been a challenging but rewarding
                learning experience. Also, I'm writing a detailed article on my
                experience in tech, I often prefer using a real-world case study
                to explain the technology so it's easier to understand.
